# GoKart

- The landing page for an imaginary e-commerce business named GoKart.
- Developed using React, Tailwind, Typescript, and Vite (my favorite front-end stack ever).
- Made as part of my journey through the Odin Project's Javascript path. [This](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) is the project page.
